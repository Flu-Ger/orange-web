<screenshot id="nomogram" title="Naive Bayesian nomogram" rank="30">
<description>Naive Bayesian Nomogram constructed from the Titanic data
set. Used for prediction (blue dots) it shows that the probability of
survival of women travelling in the second class. Nomograms are easy to
interpret: chances of survival are elevated for children and women in
the first class, and worst for male passengers travelling in the third
class or as a crew.</description>

<description>Clicking on a node of classification tree outputs the associated
data, which can be further processed in any other widget. Screenshot
below shows a schema where we use File widget to read the Iris
data set, construct a decision tree, and visualize it. Schema also
includes a scatterplot that displays the original data (the channel
from File widget), and also receives a data subset from Classification
Tree Viewer. The data subset is marked with filled dots. By clicking on
different nodes of the tree the selection in scatterplot changes,
making this schema an interesting interactive exploration tool.</description>

<description>Logistic regression and naive Bayesian nomograms show little
difference when compared on Titanic data sets. For comparison, naive
Bayesian nomogram was left-aligned (and in such setting denied the
otherwise it's own ability to treat the missing values).</description>

pertinent to selection rules, and these can be further analyzed (as
exemplified by Distribution widget).</description>
